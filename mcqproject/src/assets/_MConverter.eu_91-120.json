    "the Microsoft Monitoring Agent",
    "the Azure Monitor agent",
    "the Azure Arc agent",

  "answer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is **the Azure Arc agent**. To onboard non-Azure machines (such as AWS or on-premises servers) into Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you must first connect them via **Azure Arc**. The Arc agent (Connected Machine agent) establishes the connection to Azure, after which Defender for Cloud can provision additional monitoring agents (like Azure Monitor or the new Azure Monitor Agent).\n\n- **A. Microsoft Monitoring Agent:** Deprecated in favor of the Azure Monitor Agent, and still requires Azure Arc first.\n- **B. Azure Monitor agent:** Needed for telemetry, but cannot be installed directly without Azure Arc onboarding.\n- **C. Azure Arc agent:** Correct — required as the first step to connect the server to Azure services.\n- **D. Azure Pipelines agent:** Used for DevOps CI/CD pipelines, irrelevant for Defender onboarding.\n\nReference: [Microsoft Learn – Connect hybrid machines to Defender for Cloud using Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-machines)."

These logs contain detailed information about read, write, and delete requests against blob storage, including the identity of the caller, the timestamp, and the type of operation performed. This is the only way to determine specifically which blobs were deleted.\n\n- **A. Activity logs of storage1:** Show management operations (like updating storage account settings), but not detailed blob-level operations.\n- **B. Azure Storage Analytics logs:** Correct — include detailed storage transaction information, such as blob deletions.\n- **C.

These indicate suspicious activity that requires investigation but are not yet confirmed as active threats.\n\n- **Informational:** Used for benign events that don’t represent threats.\n- **Low:** Used for alerts that pose minimal risk.\n- **Medium:** Correct — used for alerts involving suspicious user behavior, unusual sign-ins, or possible credential misuse.\n- **High:** Reserved for confirmed threats or activities with immediate risk (e.g., confirmed malware execution).\n\nReference: [Microsoft Learn – Security alerts in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/security-alerts)."

  "explanation": "To automatically notify Teams when a new Secure Score recommendation appears:\n1. **Configure workflow automation** in Defender for Cloud to define what action to take when recommendations are generated.\n2. **Configure a trigger condition** to ensure only Secure Score related actions trigger the workflow.\n3. **Create a Logic App** that includes the Defender for Cloud recommendation trigger and sends a Teams message.\n\nOther sequences (alerts or compliance assessment triggers) do not match the requirement to act on **Secure Score recommendations**.\n\nReference: Microsoft Learn – [Workflow automation in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/workflow-automation)."

  "question": "You have an Azure subscription that uses Microsoft Defender for Cloud and contains 100 virtual machines that run Windows Server.\nYou need to configure Defender for Cloud to collect event data from the virtual machines. The solution must minimize administrative effort and costs.\nWhich two actions should you perform?",
  "options": [
    "Configure auto-provisioning by setting the security event storage to Common.",
    "From the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, enable automatic enrollment.",
    "From the Azure portal, create an Azure Event Grid subscription.",
    "Configure auto-provisioning by setting the security event storage to All Events.",
    "From Defender for Cloud in the Azure portal, enable Microsoft Defender for Servers."
  ],
  "answer": [0, 4],
  "explanation": "To collect event data for Defender for Cloud while minimizing cost and administrative effort:\n- **Enable Defender for Servers (E)**: This automatically provisions the required monitoring agents on VMs.\n- **Configure auto-provisioning with 'Common' event collection (A)**: This provides the essential security logs (logons, account changes, policy changes, etc.) without incurring the higher costs of 'All Events.'\n\nOther options:\n- **Microsoft Endpoint Manager (B)** is for device enrollment, not VM event collection.\n- **Event Grid subscription (C)** is unrelated to security log collection.\n- **All Events (D)** is valid but much more costly, not aligned with minimizing cost.\n\nReference: Microsoft Learn – [Data collection in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/enable-data-collection)."

  "question": "You have an Azure subscription that uses Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\nYou have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) subscription that contains multiple virtual machines that run Windows Server.\nYou need to enable Microsoft Defender for Servers on the virtual machines.\nWhich two actions should you perform?",
  "options": [
    "From Defender for Cloud, enable agentless scanning.",
    "Onboard the virtual machines to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.",
    "From Defender for Cloud, configure the AWS connector.",
    "Install the Azure Virtual Machine Agent (VM Agent) on each virtual machine.",
    "From Defender for Cloud, configure auto-provisioning."
  ],
  "answer": [2, 4],
  "explanation": "To onboard AWS virtual machines into Microsoft Defender for Servers:\n- **Configure the AWS connector (C)** in Defender for Cloud. This establishes the integration between Azure and AWS.\n- **Configure auto-provisioning (E)** so that the required agents (Azure Monitor Agent / Defender extensions) are automatically installed on the AWS VMs.\n\nOther options:\n- **Agentless scanning (A)** is optional and not the core requirement for enabling Defender for Servers.\n- **Defender for Endpoint onboarding (B)** is separate from Defender for Servers.\n- **Azure VM Agent (D)** applies only to native Azure VMs, not AWS instances.\n\nReference: Microsoft Learn – [Connect AWS accounts to Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-aws)."

  "question": "You have an Azure subscription named Sub1 and an Azure DevOps organization named AzDO1. AzDO1 uses Defender for Cloud and contains a project that has a YAML pipeline named Pipeline1.\nPipeline1 outputs the details of discovered open source software vulnerabilities to Defender for Cloud.\nYou need to configure Pipeline1 to output the results of secret scanning to Defender for Cloud.\nWhat should you add to Pipeline1?",
  "options": [
    "inputs: 'secrets'",
    "outputs: 'secrets'",
    "categories: 'secrets'"
  ],
  "answer": [0, 2],
  "explanation": "In order for an Azure DevOps pipeline to output secret scanning results to Microsoft Defender for Cloud, the YAML pipeline definition must include:\n- **inputs: 'secrets'** → defines that secret scanning is part of the inputs.\n- **categories: 'secrets'** → classifies the results as secret scanning.\n\nOther options (like outputs) are not valid schema fields for this integration.\n\nReference: Microsoft Learn – [Defender for DevOps YAML pipeline annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-devops-pipeline)."

  "question": "You create an Azure subscription named sub1.\nIn sub1, you create a Log Analytics workspace named workspace1.\nYou enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud and configure Defender for Cloud to use workspace1.\nYou need to collect security event logs from the Azure virtual machines that report to workspace1.\nWhat should you do?",
  "options": [
    "From Defender for Cloud, modify Microsoft Defender for Servers plan settings.",
    "In sub1, register a provider.",
    "From Defender for Cloud, create a workflow automation.",
    "In workspace1, create a workbook."
  ],
  "answer": 0,
  "explanation": "To collect security event logs from Azure VMs into a Log Analytics workspace, you must configure Microsoft Defender for Servers and set the plan settings in Defender for Cloud. This ensures that security event collection is enabled and sent to the chosen workspace.\n\n- **Register a provider (B)** is only required when enabling resource providers in Azure, not for log collection.\n- **Workflow automation (C)** is used for alert-based automated responses, not log collection.\n- **Workbooks (D)** are visualization tools for analyzing data already collected; they don’t configure collection.\n\nCorrect answer: **Modify Microsoft Defender for Servers plan settings in Defender for Cloud.**\n\nReference: Microsoft Learn – [Configure security data collection in Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/enable-data-collection)."
