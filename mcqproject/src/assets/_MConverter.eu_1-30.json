  "question": "You are investigating an incident by using Microsoft 365 Defender. You need an Advanced Hunting (KQL) query to count failed sign-in authentications on three devices named CFOLaptop, CEOLaptop, and COOLaptop. Which query should you use?",
  "options": [
    "DeviceLogonEvents\n| where DeviceName in (\"CFOLaptop\", \"CEOLaptop\", \"COOLaptop\")\n| where ActionType == \"LogonFailed\"\n| summarize LogonFailures=count() by DeviceName, LogonType",
    "DeviceLogonEvents\n| where DeviceName in (\"CFOLaptop\", \"CEOLaptop\", \"COOLaptop\")\n| where ActionType == FailureReason\n| summarize LogonFailures=count() by DeviceName, LogonType",
    "DeviceEvents\n| where DeviceName in (\"CFOLaptop\", \"CEOLaptop\", \"COOLaptop\")\n| where ActionType == \"LogonFailed\"\n| summarize LogonFailures=count() by DeviceName, LogonType",

  ],
  "answer": 0,
  "explanation": "Correct query uses the DeviceLogonEvents table (sign-in activity), filters to the three device names, filters failed logons with ActionType == \"LogonFailed\", then summarizes counts by DeviceName and LogonType. Option B is wrong because ActionType is not equal to FailureReason (that is a separate column describing why it failed). Option C uses the wrong table (DeviceEvents). Option D summarizes before filtering; after summarize the ActionType column no longer exists, so the filter is invalid. References: Microsoft 365 Defender Advanced Hunting schema for DeviceLogonEvents shows ActionType values such as \"LogonFailed\" and columns DeviceName and LogonType (https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-deviceevents-table and https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-schema-device-logon-events)."

    "Use EmailAttachmentInfo as the starting table, join to IdentityLogonEvents, and use 'select 20'."
  ],
  "answer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct query starts with EmailAttachmentInfo to identify malicious emails, then joins to IdentityLogonEvents to check recipient sign-ins. To return the most recent 20 sign-ins within an hour window, the 'top 20 by Timestamp' operator is required. 'take 20' or 'limit 20' would not guarantee ordering by recency, and 'select 20' is not a valid KQL operator.

  "answer": 2,
  "explanation": "Since the threat involves an image file, the appropriate IoC type is a file hash indicator. In Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, blocking based on the file hash ensures the malicious file cannot run on endpoints.

ASR rules help reduce the attack surface of devices by blocking behaviors often used by malware, such as launching executable content from email and Office apps, running suspicious macros, or creating persistence through Outlook rules. Microsoft Defender Antivirus provides malware detection but does not directly prevent these behaviors. Windows Defender Firewall controls network traffic, not application behavior.

  "answer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct tab is 'Evidence and Response'. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, the Evidence and Response tab within an incident provides a consolidated view of all entities affected, such as devices, users, email messages, and files. It also allows response actions to be taken directly from that view. 'Investigations' refers to automated or manual investigations but does not directly list all affected entities. 'Devices' shows device-specific details only, and 'Alerts' lists alerts but not the full scope of impacted entities.

  "question": "You have a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription that is linked to a hybrid Azure AD tenant. You need to identify all the changes made to the Domain Admins group during the past 30 days. What should you use?",
  "options": [
    "The Modifications of sensitive groups report in Microsoft Defender for Identity",
    "The identity security posture assessment in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps",
    "The Azure Active Directory Provisioning Analysis workbook",
    "The Overview settings of Insider risk management"
  ],
  "answer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct option is 'The Modifications of sensitive groups report in Microsoft Defender for Identity'. Microsoft Defender for Identity monitors on-premises Active Directory activities, including changes to sensitive groups such as Domain Admins. This report provides visibility into additions and removals in these groups over a selected period. The identity security posture assessment in Defender for Cloud Apps focuses on app configurations, not AD group modifications. The AAD Provisioning Analysis workbook is for provisioning diagnostics, not monitoring group changes. Insider risk management is unrelated to group membership changes.

  "question": "You have a Microsoft 365 subscription. The subscription uses Microsoft 365 Defender and has data loss prevention (DLP) policies that have aggregated alerts configured. You need to identify the impacted entities in an aggregated alert. What should you review in the DLP alert management dashboard of the Microsoft 365 compliance center?",
  "options": [
    "The Events tab of the alert",
    "The Sensitive Info Types tab of the alert",
    "Management log",
    "The Details tab of the alert"
  ],
  "answer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct option is 'The Events tab of the alert'. In the Microsoft 365 compliance center, aggregated DLP alerts consolidate multiple related events. To review which users, files, or activities are impacted, you must open the 'Events' tab of the aggregated alert. The 'Sensitive Info Types' tab shows which classification triggered the policy, not the impacted entities. The 'Details' tab provides metadata about the alert but not a breakdown of affected items. The management log is unrelated. Reference: Microsoft Learn – 'Manage DLP alerts and alert policies' (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-alerts-manage)."

  "question": "You have a Microsoft 365 subscription that uses Microsoft 365 Defender. You plan to create a hunting query from Microsoft Defender. You need to create a custom tracked query that will be used to assess the threat status of the subscription. From the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, which page should you use to create the query?",
  "options": [
    "Threat analytics",
    "Advanced Hunting",
    "Explorer",
    "Policies & rules"
  ],
  "answer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct page is 'Advanced Hunting'. Advanced Hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender provides a query-based threat hunting tool using Kusto Query Language (KQL). It allows you to create, save, and run custom queries, including tracked queries, to assess threat status across your subscription. Threat analytics provides intelligence reports but not custom queries. Explorer is used for investigating email and collaboration threats. Policies & rules are for configuring prevention policies, not hunting queries.

  "question": "You have a Microsoft 365 subscription that uses Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. You need to add threat indicators for all the IP addresses in a range of 171.23.34.32–171.23.34.63. The solution must minimize administrative effort. What should you do in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal?",
  "options": [
    "Create an import file that contains the individual IP addresses in the range. Select Import and import the file.",
    "Create an import file that contains the IP address of 171.23.34.32/27. Select Import and import the file.",
    "Select Add indicator and set the IP address to 171.23.34.32–171.23.34.63.",
    "Select Add indicator and set the IP address to 171.23.34.32/27."
  ],
  "answer": 1,
  "explanation": "The most efficient way to cover a contiguous range of IPs in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is to use CIDR notation in the import file. The range 171.23.34.32–171.23.34.63 corresponds to the subnet 171.23.34.32/27 (32 IPs). This minimizes administrative effort because you only need one entry. Option A (individual IPs) is correct but not efficient. Option C (using a dash-separated range) is unsupported, and option D works but is less efficient than importing the file directly.

  "question": "You have an Azure subscription that uses Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. You need to ensure that you can allow or block a user-specified range of IP addresses and URLs. What should you enable first in the Advanced features from the Endpoints Settings in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal?",
  "options": [
    "Custom network indicators",
    "Live response for servers",
    "Endpoint detection and response (EDR) in block mode",
    "Web content filtering"
  ],
  "answer": 0,
  "explanation": "To allow or block specific IP addresses and URLs, you must enable 'Custom network indicators' in the Advanced features of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This enables the management of IPs, URLs, and domains as indicators of compromise (IoCs) with actions such as 'Allow', 'Alert only', or 'Alert and block'. Live response for servers is for remote investigation, EDR in block mode enhances detection/blocking of post-breach behaviors but does not configure IoCs, and web content filtering controls categories of websites but not specific custom IPs/URLs. Reference: Microsoft Learn – 'Manage indicators' (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/manage-indicators)."
